“Description”

# netpractice_42
A README.md file must be provided at the root of your Git repository.
Its purpose is to allow anyone unfamiliar with the project (peers, staff, recruiters, etc.) to quickly

of the 42 curriculum by <login1>[, <login2>[, <login3>[...]]].

brief overview.
• An “Instructions” section containing any relevant information about compilation,
installation, and/or execution.
• A “Resources” section listing classic references related to the topic (documentation, articles, tutorials, etc.), as well as a description of how AI was used —
specifying for which tasks and which parts of the project.
➠ Additional sections may be required depending on the project (e.g., usage
examples, feature list, technical choices, etc.).
Any required additions will be explicitly listed below.
• The Resources section must explicitly mention the networking concepts studied,
such as TCP/IP addressing, subnet mask, default gateway, routers and
switches, OSI layers, etc.
• The Instructions section must explain how to run the training interface (e.g., open
index.html), how to export configurations, and submission requirements.
• Submission details must state that 10 exported configuration files (one per level)
must be placed at the repository root
